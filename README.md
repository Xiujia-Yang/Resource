## Overview
This repository contains all scripts and preliminary statistics related to the key analyses in each section in Result of manuscript (MS) ***"Large-scale analysis of 2,152 Ig-seq datasets reveals key features of B cell biology and the antibody repertoire"***. These analyses can be classified into four categories, including gene usage, somatic recombination, somatic hypermutation and public clones. More details can be found in the following sections.

## Gene usage analyses


## Somatic recombination analyses


## Somatic hypermutation analyses


## Public clone analyses
### Preliminary statistics
* The 2152*2152 matrix recording all-to-all repertoire comparisons (Fig. 5A in MS)
* The table recording pairwise repertoire comparison together with the number of total clones for compared samples (Fig. 5B)
* The file containing all lines in the clones.txt file that records public clones (Fig 5C)
### Scripts
* All-to-all public clone quantification (Fig. 5A)
* All-to-all public clone visualization (Fig. 5A)
* Linear model visualization (Fig. 5B)
* Quantification and visualization of the correlation between clonality and publicness of public clones (Fig. 5C)
